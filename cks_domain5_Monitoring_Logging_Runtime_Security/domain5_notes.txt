-> check for the events generated by falco using journalctl logging daemon
The journalctl command in Linux is used to query and display messages from the systemd journal. It is used with the syntax, journalctl [arguments].

How is journalctl different from rsyslog?
The systemd-journald service does not keep separate files, as rsyslog does. The idea is to avoid checking different files for issues. Systemd-journald saves the events and messages in a binary format that cannot be read with a text editor. You can query the journal with the journalctl command.
